### Cost Attribution for Multi-cloud / Multi-platform Applications

[ [pdf](cost-attribution.pdf) ] - [ [source](./cost-attribution) ]

**Abstract**

This paper details a solution to attributing cost across common infrastructure.
The original target for the solution was a hybrid-cloud infrastructure.
This led to a comprehensive, yet flexible design.
As a result, its concepts are generic and support both cloud and non-cloud ecosystems.
The goal is to provide a single view into spend across platforms.
It needs to support a large variety of use cases, from leaders analyzing spend to teams understanding the cost of systems they consume.
